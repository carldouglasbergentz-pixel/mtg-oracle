# Changelog

All notable changes to MTG Oracle are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Git repository initialized with `.gitignore` covering generated DB, bulk data sources, Python and editor artifacts.
- `CHANGELOG.md` for traceability of schema and ingestion changes going forward.
- `cards.oracle_id`, `cards.layout`, `cards.card_faces` columns (stable Scryfall identifier, layout type, raw per-face JSON).
- `rulings.oracle_id` column + index, for joining rulings to cards via a stable key rather than name.
- `sync_state` table tracking upstream `updated_at`, `last_sync`, and `row_count` per source.
- `scripts/migrate_add_oracle_id.py` — idempotent schema migration for existing databases.
- `scripts/sync_cards.py` — fetches Scryfall `oracle_cards` and `rulings` bulk files, upserts them, and skips on unchanged upstream `updated_at`. Supports `--force`.

### Changed
- Card ingestion now pulls live from Scryfall bulk API instead of the manually-reduced MTGJSON `AtomicCards.json`.
- Double-faced, modal-DFC, split, and flip cards now preserve **all** face texts (previously the back face was silently dropped because `ingest_cards.py` read `card_info[0]` only). Combined text uses a `// ` separator between faces.
- `init_db.py` schema updated to match the new columns/tables so fresh installs match migrated ones.

### Planned
- Deprecate `scripts/ingest_cards.py` + `data/source/mtg_judge_db.json` once sync has been in use for a few cycles.
- Automate rules ingestion against Wizards' `MagicCompRules.txt` (currently still a manual `.docx` import).
- Wrap card + combo + rules sync into a single `scripts/sync.py` entrypoint and schedule via cron / Task Scheduler.
